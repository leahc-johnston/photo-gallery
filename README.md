I came up with the idea for this app as a part of my senior project course work in college. 
We had to develop an app from scratch that would be useful and innovative. 
At the time, I was working in restaurants after school to make enough money to cover my expenses. 
Whenever I would come home from work, I would write down how much money I had made in tips that evening, since that was my only form of income.
I wanted a better way to track how much I was making each day, and how much I was also spending, since many of my transactions were in cash.
Thus, "Budget Bacon" was born.
With the ability to track individual transactions throughout the day, it is versatile and helpful when on the go.
The app utilizes Firebase on the backend for user and data management. 
At the end of each day, a user's income, expenses, and net positive or negative for the day are stored for graphical reference. 
The graph feature allows users to easily see their daily spending habits as the week progresses. 
The app speaks for itself and users can navigate their income and expenses with ease!
